# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).  Users can register for an account and login securely with an email and password. Passwords are hashed, and users may only view and edit the URLS they have shortened while logged in. A shortened URL, when shared in a Twitter post etc., can be used by anyone to redirect to its linked long-form URL."
